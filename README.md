This is my **full HTML & CSS project**, inspired by the Amazon homepage. It is designed to help me understand web layout, structure, and styling fundamentals while recreating a real-world website interface.
I created this project to gain complete hands-on experience while revising my concepts of HTML and CSS, by recreating the frontend of a website like Amazon.com.
It features a fully structured Amazon-style homepage with proper styling, a navigation bar, product categories, and a search functionality.
